Title: 
Geotropism

Aim:	
To find out which parts if a plant are geotropic and whether the geotropism is positive or negative.

Materials: 
Five bean seeds, bathroom tissue, transparent jar about 8cm in diameter, tapwater, sheet of clear perforated plastic rubber band.

Procedure: 	
	Five bean seeds were obtained.
	Five layers of tissue paper were lined in a jar and was carefully moistened so that it would cling to the side of the jar.
	The seeds were distributed around the jar and were placed midway down the jar between the moistened tissue and the side of the jar. The seeds were germinate until roots were visible. The plumule and radicle was noted on the seedling and it was observed which one emerges from the testa first.
	The seeds were observe everyday and observations were recorded.

Discussion :	
Geotropism is the response of a plant to gravity. Their parts of the plant that response to geotropism were the plumule (shoot) and the radicle(root). The plumule was found to have a negative response to geotropism whereas, the radicles was found to have a positive response to geotropism. The plants were then placed in the dark to examine if sunlight is a requirement for germination.

Conclusion:	
It was concluded that the plumule(shoot) had a negative response toward geotropism and the radicle had a positive response towards geotropism.
